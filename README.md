This is the project called "Memory game" - it is the final project of the 2nd part of the Udadity FEND nanodegree. It functions like a regular memory game. Your task is to remember all the symbols on cards when you open them. You'll be given a star rating depending on the time you spend opening cards and the total number of cards you've opened.
